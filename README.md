# Does White Paper Page Count Affect \$ Raised Via ICO?

_By [Michael Rosenberg](mailto:rosenberg.michael.m@gmail.com) and [Michael McCaffrey](mailto:mike@theblockcrypto)._

Contains our work on analyzing the relationship between crypto whitepapers and 
initial close prices. For questions, feel free to contact the authors

Repo Contents:

* [`analysis`](analysis): contains our `.Rmd` files for writing this article.

  - [`analysis/wp_ico_final.Rmd`](analysis/wp_ico_final.Rmd): This is our 
  `.Rmd` of our final analysis.
  
  - [`analysis/wp_ico_final_abbreviated.Rmd`](analysis/wp_ico_final_abbreviated.Rmd): 
  This is our `.Rmd` of the abbreviated version of our final analysis. This places the
  mathematical sections of the methodology section in an appendix and shortens the
  **Next Steps** section. This essentially contains our code for the publishable version
  of the report.

* [`code`](code): Contains our code assets for data processing beyond our 
[`analysis`](analysis).

  - [`code/clean_raw_data.r`](code/clean_raw_data.r): Quick script for cutting off
  summary artifacts in our raw dataset ([`../data/raw/wp_ico.csv`](data/raw/wp_ico.csv))
  and saving the post-cutoff dataset in
  [`../data/preprocessed/cleaned_wp_ico.csv`](data/preprocessed/cleaned_wp_ico.csv).
  
* [`data`](data): Contains our raw and interim datasets generated through our analysis
as well as final datasets generated by our reports.

  - [`data/preprocessed`](data/preprocessed): contains our interim datasetes generated
  during our analysis.
  
    + [`data/preprocessed/cleaned_wp_ico.csv`](data/preprocessed/cleaned_wp_ico.csv): the
    version of [`../raw/wp_ico.csv`](data/raw/wp_ico.csv) with all the summary artifacts in
    that raw file removed via [`../../code/clean_raw_data.r`](code/clean_raw_data.r).
    
  - [`data/processed`](data/processed): contains any output datasets generated for post-report
  consumption.
  
    + [`data/processed/coef_table.csv`](data/processed/coef_table.csv): contains the `.csv` version
    of the coefficient table constructed in our reports. A `.html` version of this table is saved in
    [`../../figures/page_count_analysis/coef_table.html`](figures/page_count_analysis/coef_table.html).
    
  - [`data/raw`](data/raw): contains the raw, immutable datasets used for our analysis. All other assets
  in the `data` superdirectory are deemed to be derivatives of this subdirectory.
    
    + [`data/raw/wp_ico.csv`](data/raw/wp_ico.csv): This is the raw dataset used for our analysis. As discussed
    in our report, this dataset was generated using a manual synthesis of data from 
    [Coindesk's ICO Tracker](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker) and white paper `.pdf` checks. For more details
    on how this dataset was constructed, contact [Michael McCaffrey](mailto:mike@theblockcrypto).
    
* [`figures/page_count_analysis`](figures/page_count_analysis): Contains the figures and tables constructed for display
within our report.

  - [`figures/page_count_analysis/amount_raised_hist.png`](figures/page_count_analysis/amount_raised_hist.png): Contains the distribution of \$ Amount raised in ICO (in millions, top) and log-amount raised in ICO (in log-millions, bottom). This is
  Figure 1 in our report.
  
  - [`figures/page_count_analysis/coef_table.html`](figures/page_count_analysis/coef_table.html): Contains the `.html` version
  of the coefficient table for our final selected model. To see the model we used to get these coefficients, see 
  [`../../models/final_mod_lm.rds`](models/final_mod_lm.rds). To view a `.csv` version of this table, see
  [`../../data/processed/coef_table.csv`](data/processed/coef_table.csv).
  
  - [`figures/page_count_analysis/log_amt_raised_on_page_count.png`](figures/page_count_analysis/log_amt_raised_on_page_count.png):
  Contains Figure 3 of our report. This plots log-amount raised in ICO (in log-millions) on page count (teal). The blue line 
  represents the linear trend for the core ICO set. The dashed black line represents the page count of 54, while the red 
  dashed lines represent the mean Log-Amount Raised pre-cutoff and post-cutoff.
  
  - [`figures/page_count_analysis/page_count_hist.png`](figures/page_count_analysis/page_count_hist.png): Contains Figure 2
  of our report. This represents the distribution of page count in our dataset. We would eventually removed the white paper
  with 132 pages from our final analysis; this became a clear outlier in 
  [`log_amt_raised_on_page_count.png`](figures/page_count_analysis/log_amt_raised_on_page_count.png).
  
  - [`figures/page_count_analysis/page_count_on_month_of_close.png`](figures/page_count_analysis/page_count_on_month_of_close.png):
  Contains Figure 4 of our report. The teal points represent page count on month of close for ICOs in our modeling dataset.
  The page count means per month of close are indicated by the blue line.
  
* [`lit/links`](lit/links): Contains relevant outside links in our literature review.

  - [`lit/links/ico_tracker_website.txt`](lit/links/ico_tracker_website.txt): Contains the link to Coindesk's ICO tracker.
  You can open this in your browser via `open $(cat lit/links/ico_tracker_website.txt)`.
  
* [`models`](models): Contains the canonical models analyzed in our report.

  - [`models/final_mod_lm.rds`](models/final_mod_lm.rds): This is the final model used for our model. This is simply a
  log-linear effects model that controls for month seasonality. In formal terms, for cryptocurrency $i$, we fit
  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\small&space;\log(Amount\_Raised\_in\_ICO_i)&space;\sim&space;Page\_Count_i&space;&plus;&space;\sum_{t&space;=&space;1}^7&space;\mathbb{I}(Month\_Of\_Close_i&space;=&space;t)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\small&space;\log(Amount\_Raised\_in\_ICO_i)&space;\sim&space;Page\_Count_i&space;&plus;&space;\sum_{t&space;=&space;1}^7&space;\mathbb{I}(Month\_Of\_Close_i&space;=&space;t)" title="\small \log(Amount\_Raised\_in\_ICO_i) \sim Page\_Count_i + \sum_{t = 1}^7 \mathbb{I}(Month\_Of\_Close_i = t)" /></a>

  - [`reports/wp_ico_final.pdf`](reports/wp_ico_final.pdf): Contains the final report generated by
  [`../analysis/wp_ico_final.Rmd`](analysis/wp_ico_final.Rmd).

  abbreviated final report generated by 
  [`../analysis/wp_ico_final_abbreviated.Rmd`](analysis/wp_ico_final_abbreviated.Rmd). This is
  essentially [`wp_ico_final.pdf`](reports/wp_ico_final.pdf) with a shortened *Methodology* section,
  a shortened **Next Steps** section, and a **Methodology Appendix** included for the deep dive of our
  methodological processes. This will be used as the basis for our Wordpress article.
